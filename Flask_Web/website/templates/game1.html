                        <p>
                            Undertale is a one-of-a-kind RPG where every choice you make has lasting consequences, influencing the story, characters, and even the battles themselves. 
                            Released in 2015, it gained instant acclaim for its unique storytelling and replayability. 
                            Its soundtrack, composed entirely by Toby Fox, shifts seamlessly between lighthearted chiptunes, intense boss themes, and emotional melodies, creating a deeply personal and memorable experience for each player.
